    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a client side programming language. It was first developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape. JavaScript is a bantam programming language that allows the users to connect with features of web pages developed by the programmers through a script form displaying updates and standard web technologies.It goes beneath the name of JavaScript formerly known as livescript</p> 
    <p>JavaScript has many libraries such as - Angular, Node.js, React, JQuery, etc.</p>

    <h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px">
        <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Speed and Reliable:</b> JavaScript is very fast and reliable as it can compile immediately within the client-side browser. The backend server are so strong that we don't have to wait for a page to reload which means it is much more reliable than other programming languages.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Less server interaction:</b> You can approve client contribution before sending the page off to the server. This spares server traffic, which implies less burden on your server.</li>
        
        <li>
            <b>Increased interactivity:</b> You can make interfaces that respond when the client floats over them with a mouse or enacts them through the console.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Versatility</b>Nowadays, there are many ways to use JavaScript through Node.js servers. If you were to bootstrap node.js with Express, utilize an archive database like mongodb, and use JavaScript toward the front-end for customers, it is conceivable to build up a whole JavaScript application from front to back utilizing just JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    

    <h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
     <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Client-Side Security: </b> Since the code executes on the clients' PC, now and again it very well may be misused for malignant purposes. This is one explanation a few people decide to debilitate Javascript.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Limited Application Support:</b> JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Browser Compatibility:</b> JavaScript face a lot of compatibility issues on different browsers. Although the server-side scripting produces same output but client-side gives a little bit different output.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="usages">Usages</h2>
    <div style="margin-left: 10px;">
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript can fix format issues utilizing javascript you can discover the position and area of any component on the page and the elements of the program window. </li>

        <li>JavaScript can enhance the interfaces HTML gives us. While it is nice to have a text input box you might want to have a combo box allowing you to choose from a list of preset values or enter your own. Using JavaScript, you can enhance a normal input box to do that.</li>

        <li>Data that changes continually can be stacked periodically without the requirement for user communication, for instance, sports match outcomes or financial exchange tickers.</li>

        <li>You can use JavaScript to animate components on a page — for instance, to show and hide data or feature explicit segments of a page — this can make for a progressively usable more extravagant user experience.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="code">Code Examples</h2>
    <div>
        <div class="codeExample1">
            <p>This example is about how to pass a function as a callback. So for this two different functions are taken, add and multiply, are passed as a parameter to the function activity obviously just a reference to the capacity is passed. The functions add and multiply are called callbacks or all the more fittingly called callback functions. The function activity will get back to it (i.e. invoke it) with the two argument values provided. Callback functions plays a crucial role in numerous frameworks, in addition to jQuery.

     <p>JavaScript also gives us ability to modify DOM(Document Object Model). You can store an element in a variable and then use it to get value from it or store value on it. You can also modify styles of an element using JavaScript DOM. DOM although useful can lead to increasing load on the browser to render the entire webpage whenever a DOM element is manipulated as the entire DOM is recreated and then re-rendered.</p>
